    "这个博弈迷人之处在于简单：对于个人而言，最大收益是偷偷背叛，对于总体而言，最大收益是合作。需要注意，当背叛的收益为9时，这种情况不叫做囚徒困境，因为轮流背叛将会成为最大收益的选择。\n",

    "\n",
    "Pareto Efficient 指的是，所选择的行为，不能够让所有人都变得更好，在这种情况下， 认为达到了帕拉图最优。对于(4,4)而言，向(0,6),(6,0)偏斜均损害了了一个玩家的利益。对于(0,6)而言，向(2,2),(4,4)偏斜也损害了某个玩家的利益，因此除了(2,2)，其余均为帕拉图最优。总体偏好总是指向合作。\n",

    "## Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "纳什均衡假设人们会最大化自身利益。如果玩家1选择合作，那么作为玩家2，最好是背叛，那么，玩家1会选择继续背叛，最后总会达到(2,2)的均衡，因为两人都为了维护自己的利益。个人偏好总是指向背叛。\n",
